# NAME OF THE MODEL
model_name: stoch_compart_SIR


# DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
model_info:
  abstract: 'This model is a simple discrete-time, stochastic,
  compartment-based SIR model. In EMULSION, a model is characterized
  by several sections (time_info, processes, state_machines, etc.)
  which are detailed below.

  The organization of this document mainly relies upon correct
  indentation (2 white spaces) to move from section to sub-section.'

# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each state can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.
