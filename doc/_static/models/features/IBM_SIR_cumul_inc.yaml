# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each change can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.
state_machines:
  # Below, the definition of the state machine used by the process
  # 'infection'
  health_state:
    desc: 'The state machine which defines the evolution of health
    states
    '
    # Below, the list of states with their attributes.
    states:
      - S:
          name: 'Susceptible'
          desc: 'suceptible of becoming infected'
          fillcolor: 'wheat'
      - I:
          name: 'Infectious'
          desc: 'infected and able to transmit the disease'
          fillcolor: 'maroon'
          on_enter:
            - record_change: cumulative_incidence
      - R:

          desc: 'healthy again and resistant to infection'
          fillcolor: 'deepskyblue'
    # Below, a list of transitions between states, with rate or
    # probabilities. Rates are automatically converted into
    # probabilities w.r.t the duration of the time step (delta_t),
    # assuming a classical exponential distribution of durations in

    transitions:
