# NAME OF THE MODEL
model_name: hybrid_SIR


# DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
model_info:
  abstract: 'This model is a simple discrete-time, stochastic,
  "hybrid" SIR model, i.e. with individuals grouped according to
  relevant variables such as their health state. A lockdown occurs
  during epidemics to flatten the curve.

# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.

  population:
    infection:
      machine_name: health_state
      key_variables: [health_state]

# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each change can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.

  # Below, the definition of the state machine used by the process
  # 'infection'
  health_state:
    desc: 'The state machine which defines the evolution of health
    states
    '
    # Below, the list of states with their attributes.
    states:
      - S:
          name: 'Susceptible'
          desc: 'suceptible of becoming infected'

          name: 'Infectious'
          desc: 'infected and able to transmit the disease'
          fillcolor: 'maroon'
      - R:
          name: 'Resistant'

          fillcolor: 'deepskyblue'
    # Below, a list of transitions between states, with rate or

    # probabilities w.r.t the duration of the time step (delta_t),
    # assuming a classical exponential distribution of durations in
