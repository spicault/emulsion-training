# NAME OF THE MODEL
model_name: hybrid_gest


# DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
model_info:
  abstract: 'This model is a simple discrete-time, stochastic,
  hybrid model with explicit gestation and age. Individuals are also
  grouped automatically by parity, i.e. the number of successful
  gestations.'

# ORGANIZATION LEVELS USED IN THE SIMULATION
# A hybrid model considers two levels: the population and
# its components (individuals)
levels:
  herd:
    desc: 'level of the population'
    aggregation_type: 'hybrid'
    contains:
      - animals
  animals:

# LIST OF PROCESSES (IN ORDER) TO BE EXECUTED DURING EACH TIME STEP
# In a hybrid model, processes take place at the population level
# (here, herd) and are managed by groupings
processes:
  animals:
    - age_group: age_and_sex
    - sex: age_and_sex
    - parity: parities

# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.

grouping:
  herd:
    age_and_sex: [age_group, sex]
    parities: [parity]
