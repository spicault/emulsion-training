# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.
grouping:
  population:
    infection:
      machine_name: health_state
      key_variables: [health_state]

# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each change can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.

  # 'infection'

    states

    # Below, a list of transitions between states, with rate or

    # probabilities w.r.t the duration of the time step (delta_t),
    # assuming a classical exponential distribution of durations in
