Model 5 (M4 + scale change)
***************************

The scale change by itself is rather straight:

- the metapopulation is just another level with a specific aggregation
  type
- initialization relies on prototypes as previously, there are new
  prototypes for populations
- some parameters (e.g. initial prevalence) become variables attached
  to populations

The main changes here are the use of Python add-ons to specify processes
which are not yet provided by generic features in EMULSION: here,
selection and movement of hosts from one population to another. The
corresponding levels (``population`` and ``metapop``) are explicitly
linked with a python file (``model5.py``) and with class names
(``Population`` and ``Metapop`` respectively).

Processes which take place at a given level and do not relate to any
grouping indentifier are assumed to be methods in the class linked to
this level.

File with full comments: `model5.yaml <../_static/benchmark/model5.yaml>`_

YAML model file :

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model5-short.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 17-23, 29-30, 47-48, 50, 54, 210-216, 219-227, 261-265

Python add-on :

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model5.py


To run the model (one stochastic repetition):

.. code-block:: bash

  emulsion run --plot model5.yaml -r 1

Which produces `the following outputs <../_static/benchmark/model5-outputs.html>`_


State machine diagrams are the same as in Model 4.
