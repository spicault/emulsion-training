Model 4 (M3 + vectors)
**********************

Species are introduced as states of a new state machines (without any
transition). A dedicated age group  called Undefined is added to
indicate that vectors do not follow the Juvenile/Adult transitions in
this model. Otherwise, other modifications in the model are very
similar to what was done for structured populations.

File with full comments: `model4.yaml <../_static/benchmark/model4.yaml>`_

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model4-short.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 26-28, 38, 43-53, 90-92, 74-77, 102, 105, 150-184, 203-217, 225-228

To run the model for 20 stochastic repetitions:

.. code-block:: bash

  emulsion run --plot model4.yaml -r 20 --silent

Which produces the following outputs:

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-output1.png
   :width: 75%

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-output2.png
   :width: 75%

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-output3.png
   :width: 75%

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-output4.png
   :width: 75%

To produce the diagrams of the state machines which control health
states, age groups and species:

.. code-block:: bash

   emulsion diagrams model4.yaml

Which gives:

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-VH.dot

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-SIR.dot

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model4-UJA.dot


To view model parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

   emulsion show model4.yaml

which produces:

.. literalinclude:: ../_images/benchmark/model4.txt
