Model 3 (Model 2 + contact structure in population)
***************************************************

Due to current limitations in the implementation of compartement-based
models, we used for this exercise a "hybrid" modelling paradigm where
individuals are grouped automatically, according to their health state
and age group.

In the experiments below, we assume that only juveniles are initially
infected (to see the infection spread among adults).

File with full comments: `model3.yaml <../_static/benchmark/model3.yaml>`_

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model3-short.yaml


To run the model for 100 stochastic repetitions:

.. code-block:: bash

  emulsion run --plot model3.yaml -r 100 --silent

Which produces the following outputs:

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model3-output1.png
   :width: 75%

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model3-output2.png
   :width: 75%

.. image:: ../_images/benchmark/model3-output3.png
   :width: 75%

To produce the diagrams of the state machines which control health
states and age groups:

.. code-block:: bash

   emulsion diagrams model3.yaml

Which gives:

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model3-SIR.dot

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model3-JA.dot


To view model parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

   emulsion show model3.yaml

which produces:

.. literalinclude:: ../_images/benchmark/model3.txt


It is also possible to view the description of the forces of infection
experienced by each group:

.. code-block:: bash

   emulsion describe model3.yaml force_infection_juveniles force_infection_adults

which produces:

.. literalinclude:: ../_images/benchmark/model3-2.txt
