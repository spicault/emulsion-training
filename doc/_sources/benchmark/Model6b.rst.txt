Model 6b (M6 + vector diffusion)
********************************

At this stage this exercise requires to add a large amount of specific
code to EMULSION since the simulation engine does not provide generic
mechanisms for spatially explicit models.

Hence, we did not implement this exercise within EMULSION.
