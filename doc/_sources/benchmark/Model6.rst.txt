Model 6 (M5 + external forcing data)
************************************

In this example, introducing external forcing data
(`moves.csv <../_static/benchmark/moves.csv>`_) has an impact on the
Python code add-ons:

- at instantiation, class ``Metapopulation`` reads the CSV file and
  restructures the data in a more convenient way (nested dictionaries,
  keys being time steps instead of dates, and ID of source
  populations)
- other processes at population scale are redefined to take those data
  into account
- the metapopulation handles data-driven movements coming from outside
  the metapopulation, to create new host individuals with the proper
  age group. Their health state is determined according to the
  expression ``external_risk`` defined in section ``parameters``.

Besides, to be able to set this external risk to the prevalence in the
metapopulation, aggregate variables are defined in the EMULSION model
(in section ``levels``) to compute the total number of infectious
individuals and the total number of individuals respectively in the
metapopulation (by aggregating the corresponding values collected at
the population level). These variables are computed only when actually
used.

File with full comments: `model6.yaml <../_static/benchmark/model6.yaml>`_

YAML model file :

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model6-short.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 14, 23-31, 37-38, 216-232, 284-295

Python add-on :

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model6.py



To have some data-driven movements considered coming from outside the
metapopulation, we ran the model with 10 populations instead of 20
(one stochastic repetition):

- with constant external risk (0.1) for individuals coming from outside the
  metapopulation:

  .. code-block:: bash

    emulsion run --plot model6.yaml -r 1 -p nb_populations=10 -p use_metapop_prevalence=0

  which produced `the following outputs <../_static/benchmark/model6-constant-outputs.html>`_
- with external risk equal to the prevalence in the whole
  metapopulation:


  .. code-block:: bash

    emulsion run --plot model6.yaml -r 1 -p nb_populations=10 -p use_metapop_prevalence=1

  which produced `the following outputs <../_static/benchmark/model6-metapop-outputs.html>`_


State machine diagrams are the same as in Model 4.
