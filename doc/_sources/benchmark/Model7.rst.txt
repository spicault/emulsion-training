Model 7 (M6 + new epidemiological state)
****************************************

Introducing a new epidemiological state at a late stage in modelling
mainly consists in modifying the ``health_state`` state machine:

- a new state ``E`` is added to the list of states, associated with the
  specification of a duration (defined in ``parameters`` as a
  species-dependent expression)
- the transition from ``S`` to ``I`` is split into a transition from ``S``
  to ``E`` and a transition from ``E`` to ``I``
- in ``parameters``, expressions defining the prevalence are modified to count also
  individuals in ``E`` state

To produce the diagrams of the state machines which control health
states, age groups and species:

.. code-block:: bash

   emulsion diagrams model7.yaml

Which gives:

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model7-VH.dot

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model7-SEIR.dot

.. graphviz:: ../_images/benchmark/model7-UJA.dot


The Python add-on was exactly the same as in Model 6.

Model file with full comments: `model7.yaml <../_static/benchmark/model7.yaml>`_

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/benchmark/model7-short.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 86-90, 100-105, 173-178, 211-213, 240-248

To have some data-driven movements considered coming from outside the
metapopulation, we ran the model with 10 populations instead of 20
(one stochastic repetition) with constant external risk (0.1) for
individuals coming from outside the metapopulation:

.. code-block:: bash

  emulsion run --plot model7.yaml -r 1 -p nb_populations=10 -p use_metapop_prevalence=0

which produced `the following outputs <../_static/benchmark/model7-outputs.html>`_
