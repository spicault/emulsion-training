    "\n",
    "In most models, the durations in each state are assumed to follow exponential distributions. EMULSION allows to specify non-exponential durations in compartmental, IBM and hybrid models by adding a property `duration: value` to a state description. This value has to be defined in the `parameters:` section, either as a constant or as an expression, including the sampling in a statistical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When individuals (even \"virtual\" as in compartmental models) enter a state endowed with a `duration` property, they take a value (either constant or drawn in a distribution) and will not be allowed to leave the state before the end of this duration — unless they have a transition marked with an `escape` condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Constant duration for juveniles\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate that, first we want to replace the duration in the juvenile state (J), which is by defaut an exponential distribution of average $1/maturation$, by a constant duration `dur_juvenile` equal to $1/maturation$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- open file [exercises/step3.yaml](exercises/step3.yaml) and rename the model as `stoch_compart_SIR_JA_dur`\n",
    "- in the definition of state J, add the following property: `duration: dur_juvenile`, then define parameter `dur_juvenile` accordingly\n",
    "- then, you have to **change the transition** from J to A by replacing `rate: maturation` by `proba: 1` — this means that any individual that has spent the correct duration in J is allowed to move to A, but not before\n",
    "- finally, we do not want individuals waiting in the J state to be preserved from mortality! we thus have to allow the transition from J to D to be active during the duration in J: i.e. mark this transition with the property `escape: yes`\n",
