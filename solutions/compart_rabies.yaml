# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.

# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each state can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.
