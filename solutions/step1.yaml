# NAME OF THE MODEL
model_name: stoch_compart_SIR


# DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
model_info:
  abstract: 'This model is a simple discrete-time, stochastic,
  compartment-based SIR model. In EMULSION, a model is characterized
  by several sections (time_info, processes, state_machines, etc.)
  which are detailed below.

  The organization of this document mainly relies upon correct
  indentation (2 white spaces) to move from section to sub-section.

# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.

  herd:

# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each state can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.

  # Below, the definition of the state machine used by the process
  # 'infection'

    desc: 'The state machine which defines the evolution of health
    states

    # Below, the list of states with their attributes.
    states:

          name: 'Susceptible'
          desc: 'suceptible of becoming infected'

    # Below, a list of transitions between states, with rate or
