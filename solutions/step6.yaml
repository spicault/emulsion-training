# NAME OF THE MODEL
model_name: stoch_hybrid_SIR_demo_duration_structured

# DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
model_info:
  abstract: 'This model is a simple discrete-time, stochastic,
  hybrid SIR model with demography and age structure, with
  non-exponential durations in state J. Besides, a contact
  structure is added to account for physical separation between
  Juveniles and Adults.

# DESCRIPTION OF GROUPINGS, ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSES WHICH ARE NOT
# DIRECTLY BASED ON STATE MACHINES
# A grouping is based on one or more variables. For instance, the
# grouping for managing the 'infection' process is based on the
# variable 'health_state' (coming from the state machine with the same
# name): hence, one group will be defined for all possible values of
# the health_state variable.
# Groupings are requimaroon for defining processes in compartement-based
# or hybrid models.
grouping:
  herd:
    infection:
      machine_name: health_state
      # grouping for infection now relies on two variables: the health
      # state but also the age_group since the value of variables
      # is_A/is_J used in the force of infection is determined by the
      # age group
      key_variables: [health_state, age_group]
    aging:
      machine_name: age_group
      key_variables: [age_group]

# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each state can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.
